			\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Functions of Two Variables}
			\callout{17}{
				A \textbf{function of two variables} is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair of real numbers in its domain to a real number in its range.
			}
			For a function $z = f(x, y)$, $x$ and $y$ are the \textbf{independent variables} and $z$ is the \textbf{dependent variable}. \\
			A function of two variables is a function with its domain as a subset of $\R^2$ and its range is a subset of $\R$.
		\subsection*{Graphs}
			\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Graphs}
			\callout{17}{
				The \textbf{graph} of two-variable function $f$ is the set of all points $(x, y, z)$ in $\R^3$ such that $z = f(x, y)$ and $(x, y)$ is in a subset of $\R^2$.
			}
		\subsection*{Level Curves and Contour Maps}
			\callout{17}{
				The \textbf{level curves} of a function $F$ of two variables are the curves with equations $f(x, y) = k$ where $k$ is a constant within the range of $f$.
			}
			A collection of level curves is a \textbf{contour map}.
	\section{Limits and Continuity}
		\subsection*{Limits of Functions of Two Variables}
		\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Limits of Functions of Two Variables}
			The notation
				\[\lim_{(x, y) \to (a, b)} f(x, y) = L\]
				is used to denote that the values of $f(x, y)$ approaches $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$ and $y$ approaches $b$.
			\callout{17}{
				For a function of two variables $f$, the \textbf{limit of $\bm{f(x, y)}$ as $\bm{(x, y)}$ approaches $\bm{a, b}$} is denoted as
				\[\lim_{(x, y) \to (a, b)} f(x, y)\].
				This is equal to $L$ if, for every $\epsilon > 0$ there is a corresponding number $\delta > 0$ such that 
					\[(x, y) \in D \land 0 < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2} < \delta \implies |f(x, y) - L| < \epsilon\]
			}
		\subsection*{Showing that a Limit Does Not Exist}
			\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Showing that a Limit Does Not Exist}
				The limit does not exist at $(a, b)$ if $f$ approaches two different values when approaching from different paths.
		\subsection*{Properties of Limits}
			\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Properties of Limits}
			The following are true of limits:
				\begin{align*}
					\lim_{x \to a}[f(x) \pm g(x)] &= \lim_{x\ to a}f(x) \pm \lim_{x\ to a}g(x) &
						\lim_{x \to a} cf(x) &= c\lim_{x\to a}f(x) \\
					\lim_{x \to a}[f(x) \times g(x)] &= \lim_{x \to a} f(x) \times \lim_{x \to a} g(x) &
						\lim_{x \to a}\left[\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right] &= \frac{\lim_{x \to a}f(x)}{\lim_{x \to a}g(x)}
				\end{align*}
			A \textbf{polynomial} function is a sum of terms in the form $cx^my^n$ where $c$ is a constant and $m$ and $n$ are nonnegative integers. A \textbf{rational function} is a ratio of two polynomials.
		\subsection*{Continuity}
			\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Continuity}
				\callout{17}{
					A function $f(x, y)$ is \textbf{continuous} at $(a, b)$ if
						\[\lim_{(x, y) \to (a, b)}f(x, y) = f(a, b)\]
					It is continuous on an interval if this it is continuous at every point within.
				}
				Polynomials and rational functions are continuous on their entire domains.
		\subsection*{Functions of Three or More Variables}
			\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Functions of Three or More Variables}
				Everything thus far can be extended to functions of more than two variables.
	\section{Partial Derivatives}
		\subsection*{Partial Derivatives of Functions of Two Variables}
			A \textbf{partial derivative} of a two-variable function assumes treats all but the variable being differentiated with respect to as constants. It is the instantaneous rate of change in the direction of the variable. \\
			The partial derivative of a function $f$ with respect to variable $x$ is denoted $f_x$. It can also be denoted as
				\[\pder{f}{x}\]
			\callout{17}{
				The partial derivatives of a function $f$ are the functions $f_x$ and $f_y$, defined as
					\begin{align*}
						f_x(x, y) &= \lim_{h \to 0}\left[\frac{f(x + h, y) - f(x, y)}{h}\right] &
						f_y(x, y) &= \lim_{h \to 0}\left[\frac{f(x, y + h) - f(x, y)}{h}\right]
					\end{align*}
			}
			The partial derivative of $f(x, y)$ with respect to $x$ is the slope of the tangent line parallel to the $x$-axis while that with respect to $y$ is the slope of the tangent line parallel to the $y$-axis.
