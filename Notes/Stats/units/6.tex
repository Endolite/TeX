		A \textbf{significance test} is a procedure that uses observed data to test between two claims, often made regarding parameters, about hypotheses. \\
		The \textbf{null hypothesis} ($\pmb{H_0}$) claims that the parameter is equal to a \textbf{null value}, what it was previously assumed to be, denoted by a subscript $0$ on the parameter. It is often a statement of no change or difference.
		$$H_0:\rm{parameter} < \text{null value}$$
		The claim that is attempting to be supported is the \textbf{alternative hypothesis} ($\pmb{H_a}$. It can either be \textbf{one-sided}, claiming that the parameter is greater or less than the null value, or \textbf{two-sided}, claiming simply that the parameter is not equal to the null value.
		$$H_a:\rm{parameter} \gtrless \text{null value} \lor \rm{parameter} \ne \text{null value}$$
		A test's $\pmb{P}$\textbf{-value} is the probability of evidence being found for $H_a$ that is at least as strong as it would be assuming that $H_0$ is true.
		$$P\text{-value} = P(\text{statistic supports } H_a \mid H_0)$$ \\
		The smaller the $P$-value, the lower the chances of receiving evidence of the alternative. A small $P$-value therefore supports the $H_a$. \\
		If the $P$-value is less than the \textbf{significance level} $\pmb{\alpha}$, $H_0$ can be rejected and it can be concluded that there is convincing evidence for $H_a$. If the $P$-value is greater than or equal to $\alpha$, $H_0$ cannot be rejected, and it can be concluded that there is not convincing evidence for $H_a$.
		\callout{11.74}{Claims should never be made regarding support of $H_0$, only of $H_a$.}
		When performing significance tests, two types of errors may occur. A \textbf{Type \Roman{1} error} occurs when $H_0$ is rejected despite being true; the data provided convincing evidence for $H_a$ despite $H_0$ being correct. A \textbf{Type \Roman{2} error} occurs when $H_0$ is not rejected despite $H_a$ being true; the did not provide convincing evidence for $H_a$ despite it being correct. \\
		The probability of a Type \Roman{1} error occurring is equal to $\alpha$. \\
		As $\alpha$ increases, the probability of a Type \Roman{1} error increases but that of a Type \Roman{2} error decreases.
		\section{Significance Tests about Proportions}
			In order for a significance test of $H_0:p = p_0$ to be performed, it must be verified that the distribution of $\hat{p}$ is approximately Normal assuming $H_0$.
