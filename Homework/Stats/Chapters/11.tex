		\paragraph{1. Attitudes}\ \\
			The Randomness condition is met, as an SRS is being performed. \\
			The 10\% condition is met, as the sample size of 45 is less than 100, making it less than 10\% of the population size. \\
			The Normality condition is met, as the sample size of 45 is greater than 30, meaning that Central Limit Theorem is applicable to justify Normality.
		\paragraph{5. Two-sided test}
			\begin{enumerate}[a.]
			\item
				\[\mu = \text{mean battery life of tablet computer when playing videos (hrs)}\]
					\begin{align*}
						H_0&: \mu = 11.5 & H_a^: \mu < 11.5
					\end{align*}
			\item
				The randomness condition is met, as the tablets are selected randomly. \\
				The 10\% condition is met, as over 200 tablets are likely produced per day, making the sample size of 20 less than 10\^ of the population size. \\
				The Normality condition is not met, as the sample distribution is heavily skewed right and the Central Limit Theorem does not take effect counteract this, as the sample size of 20 is less than 30.
			\end{enumerate}
		\paragraph{7. Attitudes}
			\begin{enumerate}[a.]
				\item
					\begin{align*}
						s_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}} &= \frac{29.8}{\sqrt{45}} \approx 4.442 \\
						t &= \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s_{\bar{x}}} \approx \frac{125.7 - 115}{4.442} \approx 2.409
					\end{align*}
				\item
					\[\pval = P(T > t) = \tCDF{t \approx 2.409}{\infty}{n - 1 = 45 - 1 = 44} \approx 0.01\]
					As the $\pval$ of 0.01 is less than the significance level $\alpha = 0.05$, the data provides convincing evidence that students above the age of 30 at the teacher's school have higher than average SSHA scores, and the hypothesis that they have average scores can be rejected.
